# git-issue

This is a minimalist decentralized issue management system based on Git,
offering (optional) biderectional integration with GitHub and GitLab issue management.
It has the following advantages over other systems.

* **No backend, no dependencies:**
  You can install and use _git issue_ with a single shell script.
  There's no need for a server or a database back-end, and the corresponding
  problems and requirements for their administration.
* **Decentralized asynchronous management:**
  Anyone can add, comment, and edit issues without requiring online access
  to a centralized server.
  There's no need for online connectivity; you can pull and push issues
  when you're online.
* **Transparent text file format:**
  Issues are stored as simple text files, which you can view, edit, share, and
  backup with any tool you like.
  There's no risk of losing access to your issues because a server has
  failed.
* **Git-based:**
  Issues are changed and shared through Git.
  This provides _git issue_ with a robust, efficient, portable,
  and widely available infrastructure.
  It allows you to reuse your Git credentials and infrastructure, allows
  the efficient merging of work, and also provides a solid audit trail
  regarding any changes.
  You can even use Git and command-line tools directly to make sophisticated
  changes to your issue database.

## Installation

### Administrator installation
Clone the repo and run `make install` with appropriate privileges.

### Personal installation
Clone the repo and register a git alias to the `git-issue.sh` script:

```
git config --global alias.issue '!'"${REPO_PATH}/git-issue.sh"
```

If you are using a bash shell, you can also register the autocompletion
by adding the following to your .bashrc.

```
source ${REPO_PATH}/gi-completion.sh
```

### Backward compatibility with the gi command
For backward compatibility you can also use the original _gi_ command,
by copying `gi.sh` to someplace in your path.
In this case you must register the git alias to use the auto completion feature.
If you have administrative access you can install it with
`sudo install gi.sh /usr/local/bin/gi`.
For your personal use,
assuming that the directory `~/bin` exists and is in your path,
you can install it with `install gi.sh ~/bin/gi`.
You can even put `gi` in your project's current directory and run it from there.

### Portability and testing
The `git-issue.sh` script has been tested on:
Debian GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Cygwin.
If you're running *git issue* on another system,
run the `test.sh` script to verify
its operation, and (please) update this file.

### Requirements
`git-issue` requires the *jq* and *curl* utilities.
OS X users might also need GNU date, obtained by installing `homebrew` package coreutils.
For running the tests *shellcheck* is also required.

## Use
You use _git issue_ with the following sub-commands.

### Start an issue repository
* `git issue clone`: Clone the specified remote repository.
* `git issue init`: Create a new issues repository in the current directory.
  The `-e` option uses an existing Git project repository.

### Work with an issue
* `git issue new`: Create a new open issue (with optional `-s` summary and -c "provider user repo" for github/gitlab export).
* `git issue show`: Show specified issue (and its comments with `-c`).
* `git issue comment`: Add an issue comment.
* `git issue edit`: Edit the specified issue's (or comment's with -c) description
* `git issue tag`: Add (or remove with `-r`) a tag.
* `git issue milestone`: Specify (or remove with `-r`) the issue's milestone.
* `git issue weight`: Specify (or remove with `-r`) the issue's weight.
  The weight is a positive integer that serves as a measure of importance.
* `git issue duedate`: Specify (or remove with `-r`) the issue's due date.
  The command accepts all formats supported by the `date` utility.
* `git issue timeestimate`: Specify (or remove with `-r`) a time estimate for this issue.
  Time estimates can be given in a format accepted by `date`,
  however bear in mind that it represents a time interval, not a date.
* `git issue timespent`: Specify (or remove with `-r`) the time spent working on an issue so far.
  Follows the same format outlined above.
  If the `-a` option is given, the time interval will be added together with the existing one.
* `git issue assign`: Assign (or remove `-r`) an issue to a person.
  The person is specified with his/her email address.
  The form `@name` or `name@` can be used as a shortcut, provided it
  uniquely identifies an existing assignee or committer.
  Note that if you plan to export the issue to a GitHub/GitLab repository, the assignee may be rejected if
  it doesn't correspond to a valid username, or if you don't have the necessary permissions.
* `git issue attach`: Attach (or remove with `-r`) a file to an issue.
* `git issue watcher`: Add (or remove with `-r`) an issue watcher.
* `git issue close`: Remove the `open` tag, add the closed tag
### Show multiple issues
* `git issue list`: List open issues (or all with `-a`).
   An optional argument can show issues matching a tag or milestone.
* `git issue list -l formatstring`: This will list issues in the specified format, given as an argument to `-l`.
   The following escape sequences can be used:

   - `%n` : newline
   - `%i` : issue ID
   - `%c` : creation date
   - `%d` : due date
   - `%e` : time estimate
   - `%s` : time spent
   - `%w` : weight
   - `%M` : Milestone
   - `%A` : Assignee(s)
   - `%T` : Tags
   - `%D` : Description(first line)

   If the format string is one of: (`oneline`, `short` or `full`) it will interpreted as the corresponding preset.

   Optionally, one of the above given with `-o` will order based on this field(reverse order with `-r`).

### Work with multiple issues
* `git issue filter-apply command`: Run `command` in every issue directory. The following environment variables will be set:
  - `GI_SHA` : Sha of the current issue
  - `GI_IMPORTS` : The imports directories for current issue(one on each line)
  - `GI_AUTHOR` : Author of current issue
  - `GI_DATE` : Creation date of current issue

  The command can read, add/remove or edit any of the issue's attributes.
  Some potentially useful scripts to be used with this command are in the scripts/ directory.
  Remember to inspect the results (e.g `gi git diff`) and commit them with `gi git commit -a`.

### Synchronize with remote repositories
* `git issue push`: Update remote Git repository with local changes.
* `git issue pull`: Update local Git repository with remote changes.
* `git issue import`: Import/update GitHub/GitLab issues from the specified project.
  If the import involves more than a dozen of issues or if the repository
  is private, set the environment variable `GH_CURL_AUTH` (GitHub) or `GL_CURL_AUTH` (GitLab) to the authentication token.
  For example, run the following command: `export GH_CURL_AUTH="Authorization: token badf00ddead9bfee8f3c19afc3c97c6db55fcfde"`
  You can create the authorization token through
  [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), with the `repo` and `delete_repo`(only for running the tests) permissions.
  For GitLab: `export GL_CURL_AUTH="PRIVATE-TOKEN: JvHLsdnDmD7rjUXzT-Ea"`. The `api` permission is required.
  Use the [GitLab settings](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) to create the token.
  In case the repository is part of a GitLab group, specify repository as groupname/reponame.
* `git issue create`: Create the issue in the provided GitHub repository.
  With the `-e` option any escape sequences for the attributes present in the description, will be replaced as above.
  This can be used to e.g export an unsupported attribute to GitHub as text.
* `git issue export`: Export issues for the specified project.
  Only the issues that have been imported and modified (or created by `git issue create`) by `git-issue` will be exported.
  With the `-e` option any escape sequences for the attributes present in the description, will be replaced as above.
  This can be used to e.g export an unsupported attribute to GitHub as text.
* `git issue exportall`: Export all open issues in the database (`-a` to include closed ones) to GitHub/GitLab. Useful for cloning whole repositories.

### Help and debug
* `git issue help`: Display help information about git issue.
* `git issue log`: Output a log of changes made
* `git issue git`: Run the specified Git command on the issues repository.
* `git issue dump`: Dump the whole database in json format to stdout.

Issues and comments are specified through the SHA hash associated with the
parent of the commit that opened them, which is specifically crafted for
that element and can be used to derive its date and author.

## Internals
All data are stored under `.issues`, which should be placed under `.gitignore`,
if it will coexist with another Git-based project.
The directory contains the following elements.
* A `.git` directory contains the Git data associated with the issues.
* A `config` file with configuration data.
* An `imports` directory contains details about imported issues.
  * The `sha` file under `import/<provider>/<user>/<repo>/<number>` contains the
    _git-issue_ SHA corresponding to an imported GitHub _number_ issue.
    Likewise for GitLab.
  * The `sha` file under `import/<provider>/<user>/<repo>/<number>/comments/<number>`
    contains the _git-issue_ comment SHA corresponding to an imported GitHub/GitLab
    _number_ comment.
  * The file `import/<provider>/<user>/<repo>/checkpoint` contains the SHA
    of the last imported or updated issue.  This can be used for merging
    future updates.
* An `issues` directory contains the individual issues.
* Each issue is stored in a directory named `issues/xx/xxxxxxx...`,
    where the x's are the SHA of the issue's initial commit.
* Each issue can have the following elements in its directory.
  * A `description` file with a one-line summary and a description of the issue.
  * A `duedate` file with the due date stored in ISO-8601 format.
  * A `weight` file with the weight stored as a positive integer.
  * A `timespent` and `timeestimate` file with the time estimate and time spent respectively, stored in seconds.
  * A `comments` directory where comments are stored, each with the SHA of
    a commit containing the text `gi comment mark`
    _issue SHA_.
  * An `attachments` directory where the issue's attachments are stored.
  * A `tags` file containing the issue's tags, one in each line.
  * A `milestone` file containing the issue's milestone name.
  * A `watchers` file containing the emails of persons to be notified when the issue changes (one per line).
  * An `assignee` file containing the email for the person assigned to the issue.
* A `templates` directory with message templates.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed through pull requests.
Before working on a new feature please look at open issues, and if no
corresponding issue is open, create one to claim priority over the task.
Contributions should pass tests and should be accompanied with a
corresponding test case and documentation update.
Note that to avoid duplicating information, the subcommands, the used files,
and usage examples, are automatically inserted into the script and its
documentation from the `README.md` file using the `sync-docs.sh` command.
